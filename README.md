# EC504 Final Project

## Overview

For our final project, we will create a web-based animation for some algorithms and data structures. Based on the example provided by Professor, we find out some drawbacks. The [example](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/FibonacciHeap.html) we inspected is not perfect and can't interact with user for some other algorithms.  However, we can still learn some from them. Our goal is to create a web-based animation for teaching purpose and fully interactive with user input. For example, the user can freely insert element to Fibonacci heap and shape the tree as he/she wants. Also, it will support more operation like decrease key. In general, our project will help to understand how algorithms work steps by steps by creating any input as you want.
